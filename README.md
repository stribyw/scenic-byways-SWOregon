Storymap.js is a javascript library to tell a story based on web maps. Using this library, you can create a map that follows your text. Annotate each paragraph and place a map alongside it. Then you can zoom/pan/add thematic layers to the web map as the reader reads through the text. This library is used for the course GEOG 371 Geovisualization: Web Mapping offered by Oregon State University.
